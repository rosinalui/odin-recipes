    <h2>Recipe to sublime a broken heart</h2>
    <p>Many believe that a broken heart can only be healed with time. Others believe that it can never be healed – it becomes part of you, an inerasable experience that you must learn to live with. It may be caused by the loss of your loved one; the clownery of the government(s); the shattering of your belonging.</p>
    <p>No matter what cause of a broken heart you have undergone, today we are not seeking to heal. We will be exploring the different things that are weighing on our auras. Rather than searching for a meaning, a motivation, or an end goal to this practice, we will focus on <em>action</em>. Let action precede the crippling erosions of looping analyses. And <em>breathe</em>.</p>
